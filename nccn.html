					<h3>Duty and Unity</h3>
					<p>The National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Navy, Army and Air Force, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens, which was created under the Indian Defence Act, 1917 with the Aim to make up the shortage of the Army. Upon the recommendation of the committee headed by Pandit H N, National Cadet Corps came into existence under the National Cadet Corps Act XXXI of 1948 under the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Naval Wing was introduced in 1950 and the NCC curriculum was developed at the behest of Late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who took a keen interest in the growth of the NCC. Following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, to meet the requirement of the Nation, the NCC training was made compulsory in 1963. In 1968, the Corps was again made voluntary.</p>
